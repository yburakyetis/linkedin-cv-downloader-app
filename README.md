## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Steps

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd linkedin-cv-downloader-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will install:
   - Electron (desktop application framework)
   - Playwright (browser automation)
   - Playwright-extra (enhanced Playwright with plugin support)
   - Playwright-extra-plugin-stealth (anti-bot detection evasion)

3. **Install Playwright browsers (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install chromium
   ```

## Running the Application

Start the application using:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the Electron application window.

## How to Use

### For Non-Technical HR Staff

#### First-Time Setup

1. **Launch the Application**
   - Double-click the application or run `npm start` from the terminal
   - The application window will open with a clean dashboard interface

2. **Initial Login**
   - When you click "Start Download" for the first time, a browser window will open
   - You will be automatically redirected to LinkedIn's login page
   - **Log in with your LinkedIn account credentials**
   - Wait for the login to complete (the application will wait 15 seconds for you to finish)
   - Your session will be saved automatically - you won't need to log in again unless you reset the session

#### Downloading CVs

1. **Fill in the Form Fields:**
   - **APPLICANTS_URL**: 
     - Go to your LinkedIn job posting
     - Navigate to the "Applicants" tab
     - Copy the full URL from your browser's address bar
     - Paste it into this field
     - Example: `https://www.linkedin.com/hiring/jobs/123456789/applicants/987654321`
   
   - **MAX_CV_COUNT**: 
     - Enter the maximum number of CVs you want to download
     - Default is 250
     - The process will stop once this limit is reached
   
   - **MIN_WAIT** (seconds):
     - Minimum time to wait between actions (in seconds)
     - Default is 5 seconds
     - This helps make the automation look more human-like
   
   - **MAX_WAIT** (seconds):
     - Maximum time to wait between actions (in seconds)
     - Default is 30 seconds
     - The application will randomly wait between MIN_WAIT and MAX_WAIT

2. **Start the Download:**
   - Click the **"Start Download"** button
   - A browser window will open (or use your existing session)
   - The application will automatically:
     - Navigate to the applicants page
     - Click on each applicant
     - Download their CV if available
     - Move to the next page if there are more applicants
   - You can watch the progress in the status box and log output

3. **Monitor Progress:**
   - The status box shows current operation status
   - The progress bar indicates overall completion percentage
   - The log output shows detailed information about each action
   - CVs are saved to your `Downloads/LinkedIn_CVs` folder

4. **Completion:**
   - The process will stop when:
     - The maximum CV count is reached
     - All applicants on all pages have been processed
   - A success message will display the total number of CVs downloaded

#### Resetting Your Session

If you need to log in with a different LinkedIn account:

1. Click the **"Reset Session"** button
2. Confirm the action when prompted
3. The next time you start a download, you'll be asked to log in again
4. Your new session will be saved automatically

### Important Notes

- **Session Security**: Your LinkedIn session is stored locally in the `user_data` folder. Never share this folder with others.
- **Download Location**: All CVs are saved to `~/Downloads/LinkedIn_CVs/` (or `C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\LinkedIn_CVs\` on Windows)
- **Rate Limiting**: The application includes randomized delays to avoid triggering LinkedIn's rate limits. Adjust MIN_WAIT and MAX_WAIT if you experience issues.
- **Browser Window**: The browser window will remain open during the automation process. Do not close it manually.
- **Interruptions**: If you need to stop the process, close the browser window or the application. Your session will still be saved.

### How It Works

1. **Session Management**: Uses Playwright's persistent context to maintain browser sessions across runs
2. **Stealth Mode**: Implements playwright-extra-plugin-stealth to avoid bot detection
3. **Human Simulation**: 
   - Randomized delays between actions
   - Slow mouse movements to elements before clicking
   - Natural scrolling behavior
4. **Pagination**: Automatically detects and navigates through multiple pages of applicants
5. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing CVs and continues processing

### Selectors Used

The application uses specific LinkedIn selectors which are configurable in `src/config/constants.js`.
- Applicant list items
- Details panel
- Download button
- Pagination buttons

## Troubleshooting

### "Session expired" or Login Required Every Time

- Click "Reset Session" and log in again
- Ensure the `user_data` folder has write permissions
- Check that your LinkedIn account is not requiring additional verification

### CVs Not Downloading

- Verify the APPLICANTS_URL is correct and accessible
- Check that you have permission to view applicants for the job posting
- Ensure the applicant has uploaded a CV (not all applicants have CVs available)
- Check the log output for specific error messages

### Browser Window Not Opening

- Ensure Playwright browsers are installed: `npx playwright install chromium`
- Check that no other process is using the required ports
- Try resetting the session

### Application Crashes

- Check the terminal/console for error messages
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Try deleting the `user_data` folder and starting fresh

## Security & Privacy

- All session data is stored locally on your machine
- No data is sent to external servers
- LinkedIn credentials are never stored - only session cookies
- The application only accesses LinkedIn through your browser session

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the log output in the application for specific error messages
2. Review the troubleshooting section above
3. Ensure all dependencies are up to date: `npm update`
